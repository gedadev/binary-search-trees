Methods;

1. buildBalancedTree: takes an array of data (e.g. [1, 7, 4, 23, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 67, 6345, 324]) and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed
2. insertNode, deleteNode: accepts a value to insert/delete
3. findNode: accepts a value and returns the node with the given value
4. levelOrder: traverse the tree in breadth-first level order and provide each node as the argument to the provided function
5. inOrderTraversal: traverse the tree in depth-first order
6. getHeight: accepts a node and returns its height
7. isBalanced: checks if the tree is balanced
8. reBalance: rebalances an unbalanced tree
